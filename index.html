        or repeat, have the safest and most comfortable birth possible. I want
        to make sure that you start your new journey on the right foot, knowing
        that your new baby is safe and happy.

            BIRTH DOULA <br/>
            I can be there, right by your side, making sure you get the best
            birth experience possible. Together we'll discuss what your
            boundaries and prefrences are, wether you want to be in a hospital
            or a birth center, if you want a standing birth or in bed, and we
            can talk about all your best options. And when the time comes I can
            be there to make sure that no matter how stressful it may get that
            you dont get pushed into any uncomfortable situations.

            100%, you can call on me to be there to support you through it. I
